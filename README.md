## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project was initially developed as part of a coursework for Foundations of Data Science at The University of Edinburgh. I decided to dive into a project analyzing movie trends on IMDb simply because I love movies and digging into IMDb's data, I get to explore what movies people are loving, trends in genres, and how the industry evolves over time. Plus, IMDb's database is gold for this kind of stuff—it's extensive, well-organized, and constantly updated, making it a breeze to work with and extract valuable insights.
